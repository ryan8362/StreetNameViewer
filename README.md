# StreetNameViewer
Personal project to create a device that can perform offline reverse geocoding and displays the street name I am driving on.

Background:
The purpose of this project was to find a way to develop my Python skills and learn GPS, IoT, Raspberry Pi, while also creating a device I can use.

Problem:
The problem I am solving is a slightly embarassing one as someone who was born in a generation that has been able to rely on Google Maps to navigate _everywhere_... I don't know where most roads are by name in my hometown. That changes starting now!

Google Maps has a built in feature for this, but it is not sufficient for my needs as the feature disappears on Android Auto when Spotify is added to the GUI, and the feature fails to display highway names as they are colloquially known. The text is also too small for me to regularly check safely while driving. See 

Requirements:
While planning for the project I had determined a few key needs.
  1. Budget of $150 (Cheaper than an online course)
  2. Easy to glance at safely
